    <h1>üöÄ Valorant-AI | Real-time Object Detection with YOLOv8</h1> 
    <h2>Trained on 5500+ Custom Images</h2>

This repository contains a custom-trained YOLOv8 object detection model, built specifically for high-precision detection tasks in real-time environments.
    <h3>üîç Highlights:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Trained on 5,500+ labeled images</li>
        <li>Includes custom datasets such as:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Valorant characters</li>
            <li>Headshots</li>
            <li>Merged multi-label sets</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Achieved high precision and recall on real-world gameplay footage</li>
        <li>Optimized for real-time inference</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Frameworks:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>YOLOv8 by Ultralytics</li>
        <li>Python (PyTorch)</li>
        <li>Google Colab for training</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>üì∏ Real-Time Testing:</h3>
    <p>
        Model was tested live using a custom-built application. Results showed significantly better performance than publicly available models, especially in identifying in-game actions and character details.
    </p>
    <h3>‚úÖ Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Over 5,500 labeled images used for training</li>
        <li>Achieved remarkable accuracy across multiple custom classes</li>
        <li>Optimized for real-time inference performance</li>
        <li>Trained using Ultralytics YOLOv8 on a carefully curated dataset</li>
        <li>Classes include game-specific visuals (such as headshots, player types, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

   <p>
        The model was trained and tested thoroughly, and outperformed several publicly available alternatives, especially in precision and recall.
